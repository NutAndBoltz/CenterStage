/*
 * This OpMode illustrates the concept of driving a path based on encoder counts.
 * The code is structured as a LinearOpMode
 *
 * The code REQUIRES that you DO have encoders on the wheels,
 *   otherwise you would use: RobotAutoDriveByTime;
 *
 *  This code ALSO requires that the drive Motors have been configured such that a positive
 *  power command moves them forward, and causes the encoders to count UP.
 *
 *   The desired path in this example is:
 *   - Drive forward for 48 inches
 *   - Spin right for 12 Inches
 *   - Drive Backward for 24 inches
 *   - Stop and close the claw.
 *
 *  The code is written using a method called: encoderDrive(speed, leftInches, rightInches, timeoutS)
 *  that performs the actual movement.
 *  This method assumes that each movement is relative to the last stopping place.
 *  There are other ways to perform encoder based moves, but this method is probably the simplest.
 *  This code uses the RUN_TO_POSITION mode to enable the Motor controllers to generate the run profile
 *
 * Use Android Studio to Copy this Class, and Paste it into your team's code folder with a new name.
 * Remove or comment out the @Disabled line to add this OpMode to the Driver Station OpMode list

             *
             * We first convert to YCrCb color space, from RGB color space.
             * Why do we do this? Well, in the RGB color space, chroma and
             * luma are intertwined. In YCrCb, chroma and luma are separated.
             * YCrCb is a 3-channel color space, just like RGB. YCrCb's 3 channels
             * are Y, the luma channel (which essentially just a B&W image), the
             * Cr channel, which records the difference from red, and the Cb channel,
             * which records the difference from blue. Because chroma and luma are
             * not related in YCrCb, vision code written to look for certain values
             * in the Cr/Cb channels will not be severely affected by differing
             * light intensity, since that difference would most likely just be
             * reflected in the Y channel.
             *
             * After we've converted to YCrCb, we extract just the 2nd channel, the
             * Cb channel. We do this because this op mode is designed to detect an
             * all-blue team prop.
             *
             * We then take the average pixel value of 3 different regions on that Cb
             * channel, one positioned over strike mark. The brightest blue of the 3 regions
             * is where we assume the team prop to be.
             *
             * In order for this whole process to work correctly, each region
             * should be positioned where the team prop will be located, and
             * be small enough such that only the team prop is sampled, and not any of the
             * surroundings.
